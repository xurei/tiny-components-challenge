# Rules
These are the rules of the challenge. 

It is more a checklist than an absolute list of commandments, and can evolve over time.


Make a component that
- is easy, almost instinctive to use (nothing near Formik or React Router)
- solves a particular yet simple problem almost any developer has encountered, even if almost trivial (e.g. VCenter or Sep)
- uses CSS as often as possible, and fall back to JS only if CSS is not an option (e.g. AspectRatio)
- 

The article should: 
- have a storytelling clearly defined
- explain the problem without going too deeply in it (side articles can be written if necessary)
- solve the problem instead of simply give away the result

The component MUST be released at the same time the article is written.
The package must:
- be tree-shakable
- have a StoryBook page for each component released
- have a Legacy Browsers version, or at least try to
