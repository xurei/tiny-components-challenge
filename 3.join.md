# Spaced and Join - Make React like spaces
I love React, but no one is perfect.
Among other things, there is one about React that always pisses me off. 

Let me show you an example:

```jsx harmony
const CartCount = (props) => (
    <div>
        You have {props.n} items in your cart.
    </div>
);
```

This would be better with the `props.n` part in bold. Let's wrap it around `<strong>`:
```jsx harmony
const CartCount = (props) => (
    <div>
        You have 
        <strong>{props.n}</strong>
        items in your cart.
    </div>
);
```
Here is the result:

![Where are the spaces?](3.join.problem.png)

Raaaaah, yes ! That's right. React doesn't handle spaces the same way HTML does.

This is because React threats `props.children` as an array, and somehow "trims" the content to avoid useless spaces...
As a consequence, when you put elements on successive lines, there won't be spaces in-between, like it would be in HTML.

Two options then : keep the whole text in a line, or add spaces manually with `{' '}`. 

I could keep it in one line here... But it's not always a good option. 
Well I guess I'll add these ugly `{' '}` snippets...
```jsx harmony
const CartCount = (props) => (
    <div>
        You have {' '}
        <strong>{props.n}</strong>
        {' '} items in your cart.
    </div>
);
```

Definitively ugly :-(

I wonder if I could write a component that does that more elegantly...

## The problem
The solution most often presented is to add `&nbsp;` or `{' '}` when a space is missing. 
But it is ugly, and it makes the code harder to read.

This is also not very robust. Another change in the UI, a distracted developer, and you have another space missing. 
It happened to me multiple times.

There must be a better way. A less ugly, more robust one.

## How I solved it
At first, I thought about making a component that renders as a space. Something like this:
```jsx harmony
const Space = (props) => (<span style={{display: 'inline-block', width: props.width || '0.3em'}}/>)
```

But it is not much better than the `{' '}` trick:
```jsx harmony
const CartCount = (props) => (
    <div>
        You have 
        <Space/>
        <strong>{props.n}</strong>
        <Space/>
        items in your cart.
    </div>
);
```

That's verbose. And it is no more robust than `{' '}`.

Remember that this example has only two missing spaces, but it often happens to be more missing in the same component.
It would be better to add only one component for all the missing space instead.  

...

Waaait a minute. `props.children` is an array, right ? 
What if we made a component with a space between each child ?

That sound like an interesting idea. Let's try that.

## Let's code

We want is an array with spaces between each of the children. That shouldn't be hard to write.
Let's call it `<Spaced>`.

```jsx harmony
function Spaced(props) {
    const out = []; 
    props.children.forEach((child) => {
        out.push(child);
        out.push(' ');    
    }, []);
    //Remove the last space, which is not necessary
    out.pop();
    return out;
}
```

That would make the cart look like this:
```jsx harmony
const CartCount = (props) => (
    <Spaced>
        You have 
        <strong>{props.n}</strong>
        items in your cart.
    </Spaced>
);
```


Aaaah ! Much more beautiful. 
How does it look ?

![Here they are!](3.join.solution.png)

Perfect ! 

It's not much more robust, but a bit.
I don't need to worry about changes in that component anymore. 
The spaces should be added where needed.
I still need to remember to use it, but less often.

In a sense, it is like `Array.join(' ')`, instead of returning a string, it returns a list of components. 

So, why not create a `<Join>` component while we're here ?

## Let's code, again
The code below is the same as `<Spaced>`, but with a `separator` prop instead of a hardcoded `' '`.

`<Spaced>` is rewritten to use `<Join>` to reduce code duplication.
```jsx harmony
function Join(props) {
    const out = []; 
    props.children.forEach((child) => {
        out.push(child);
        out.push(props.separator);    
    }, []);
    //Remove the last separator, which is not necessary
    out.pop();
    return out;
}
Join.propTypes = {
    separator: PropTypes.node,
};

const Spaced = (props) => Join({...props, separator: ' '});
```

## Conclusion
The `<Spaced>` is more robust and more elegant than the `{' '}` trick. 
You still need to think about using it, but once it is there, all the missing spaces will be showing.
 
I think I'll keep the `{' '}` trick in my personal toolbox, when I want to go fast. 
But when it comes to clean code, I'll use `<Spaced>` instead for sure. 

I'm not sure that `<Join>` is particularly useful. 
But it's a "free" component, just a bit more generic than `<Spaced>`.
Time will tell if it finds an use.
